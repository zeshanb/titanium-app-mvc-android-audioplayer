titanium-app-mvc-android-audioplayer
====================================

Simple Audio Player using Titanium framework with Native elements on Android.

A small example of a model view control or in this case View, Control, Style app using Titanium Appcelerator Framework that plays bismillah / basmala. 

This is a simple one view of an App made from a View, Control, and Style file. All the other code is from framework and auto generated:

View (.xml file):

Control(.js file):
https://github.com/zeshanb/titanium-app-mvc-android-audioplayer/blob/master/AudioPlayer/app/controllers/android/

Style(.tss file - JSON format text file):
https://github.com/zeshanb/titanium-app-mvc-android-audioplayer/tree/master/AudioPlayer/app/styles/android

The above might remind those who have made websites using html, javascript, and css. The three files might function differently or not at all depending on Titanium Studio SDK version, Alloy mvc version, Android SDK version, and your operating system(windows or mac).
